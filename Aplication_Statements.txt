Project Objectives:

    To help users identify parasites by common names and scientific classification.
    To provide information and known treatments for the identified parasites.

Project Scope:

    Develop a cross-platform application using C/C++.
    The application should allow users to load pictures for examination.
    The application should be able to identify parasites in user-provided pictures.
    The application should include all necessary for recognizing parasites based on their shapes and colors. Utalizing 
    an AI component will be used for this purpose, which will have the capability to learn and improve itself over time.

Stakeholders:
    Nash (Project Owner)

Functional Requirements:

    The application should load images from a specified path.
    The application should preprocess the loaded images before analysis.
    The application should run an analysis on the preprocessed images to detect parasites.
    The application should store the details of the detected parasites, including the bounding box, confidence score, and type.

Non-Functional Requirements:

    The application should load and preprocess images quickly to ensure a smooth user experience.
    The application should run the analysis accurately and efficiently.
    The application should handle errors gracefully, e.g., if there are issues with the image loading or preprocessing, the application should inform the user about the issue.
